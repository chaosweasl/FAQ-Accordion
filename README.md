Originally I thought that this project was going to be a lot easier than it actually was for me

I'll be honest and keep myself accountable: I used ChatGPT's help a lot here, and I truly needed it. You can probably see it in my code, and it's true. My main programming language was C++, and I'm incredibly good at using algorithms for problem-solving, but I'm horrible at making actual projects. I need to learn TSX syntax for next time, and also practice my CSS skills because they could use some work (although I am surprised with how well I improved on them since my first few projects), especially animations because I barely know how they work

Also, this was the first time I made the view for mobile actually look okay (because I didn't do that before for some reason)

tl;dr poop project I need to learn TSX better and more CSS before I make another one
