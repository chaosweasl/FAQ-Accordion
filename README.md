I've made several other projects before, but I never really had any direction with them, and mosty only made them just so I can practice my coding skills + learn React, so this is my first actual project with direction

Even though it seems like a really simple project, I learned a lot, I realised that I need to work on my CSS skills, so that I'm able to intuitively pick the best things to use for my website in order for it to look the way I want it to. Also, this was the first time that I made a website look pretty when resizing it. I never made my previous projects look okay-ish on mobile before, so I'm really glad I learned this aswell.

Also, my biggest issue was importing fonts. It took me such a long time but I'm so glad I learned how to
